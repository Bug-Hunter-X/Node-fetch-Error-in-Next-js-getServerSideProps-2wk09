# Next.js node-fetch Error in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using `node-fetch` within the `getServerSideProps` function in a Next.js application. The error arises because `node-fetch` is not automatically available in the serverless environment provided by Next.js.

## Problem

The provided code uses `node-fetch` to fetch data from an external API within `getServerSideProps`. This results in an error because the serverless function does not have access to the browser's built-in `fetch` API, and `node-fetch` is not included by default.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly installing and importing `node-fetch` within the Next.js project, and modifying the `getServerSideProps` function to handle any potential errors during the API call.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`. You should see an error related to `node-fetch` being unavailable.

## Solution Implemented

The solution is implemented in the `bugSolution.js` file and explains how to fix this problem.
